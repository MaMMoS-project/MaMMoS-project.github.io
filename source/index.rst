What is MaMMoS about?
---------------------

Magnetic materials are essential for many applications in energy, information, and communication technologies.
However, the complex phenomena at different length and time scales often limit the development of new magnetic
materials and devices. The goal of this project is to develop a magnetic multiscale modeling suite that will
allow the design and optimisation of magnetic materials and devices based on multiscale modelling,
characterisation, and numerical optimisation.
